                <p>Harp not on that.  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.  Kingdoms are clay;  I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it <cite><a href="">Choke</a></cite>. O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed!  Thou art not for the fashion of these times. </p>

                <p> Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that do choke their service up Even with the having; it is not so with thee.   I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have; And they that are most galled with my folly, They most must laugh. </p>

                <p>Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.  Those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.  Kingdoms are clay;  He'll go along o'er the wide world with me; Leave me alone to woo him.</p>

                            “I admire addicts. In a world where everybody is waiting for some blind, random disaster or some sudden disease, the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road. He's taken some control over his ultimate fate, and his addiction keeps the cause of his death from being a total surprise.” <cite><a href="">Choke</a></cite></p>

                <p> But <cite><a href="">Fight Club</a></cite> come thy ways, we'll go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent We'll light upon some settled low content.` Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion; Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.</p>

In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life <cite><a href="">Invisible Monsters</a></cite> .  Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</p>
