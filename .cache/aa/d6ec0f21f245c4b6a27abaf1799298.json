I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure do we seize into our hands, Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/f623fdca104b72bc81681dd218769310.jpg\" title=\"Someone showing the first page of the book snuff where is only shown the title and the author name\" alt=\"Someone showing the first page of the book snuff where is only shown the title and the author name\"> <figcaption> Snuff, written by Chuck Palahniuk <br> <strong>Source:</strong> <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mediaplease/4228007758/in/photolist-9UNCWD-2jEoC-M4BHB-5pZzn3-7ZqXvU-7rBDpu-8whVzZ-8ghJTx-ABkQT-7xedCj-oPX3X9-pLNvsc-pLNvop-puphzW-pLSNrm-oQ16yK-pLNvJe-g6iv5-6vHpYP-2gugkjm-fLvoH-NpuCJ-84o1Ff-8iqZGv-oJ2sHe\">Just Surrender / Fickr. </a> <br> <strong>License: </strong><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">(CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) </a> </figcaption> </figure> <p>Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I do. Look, here comes the Duke. Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure do we seize into our hands, Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee.</p> <p>To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. I think he be transform'd into a beast; For I can nowhere find him like a man. It is my only suit, Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise. Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure do we seize into our hands, Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth Of what we think against thee. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.</p> </section> <section> <h3>Books and novels</h3> <div id=\"bookDisplay\"></div> </section> </main> <footer> <ul> <li><span id=\"copyrightDate\"></span> &#169; Rubén Puerta Córdoba</li> <li><a href=\"/13c18645edbc4f5beed8966a353b0776.html\">Privacy Policy</a></li> </ul> <a href=\"#title\"><i id=\"goUp\" class=\"fa-arrow-up fas\"></i></a> </footer> <script src=\"/168726dbe96b3ce427e7fedce31bb0bc.js\"></script> <script src=\"https://kit.fontawesome.com/ed6852be76.js\" crossorigin></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"d493d2121ac08f7b365056ec23077883","cacheData":{}}
